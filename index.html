        <p class="lead mb-4">Embarking on my professional journey, I graduated from Diamond Bar High School in May 2023, marking the beginning of an exciting chapter as a rising freshman at UC Riverside. My academic pursuits have been complemented by hands-on experiences, including a transformative internship at Davis Elen Advertising. As an intern from June to August 2022, I delved into the intricacies of agency functions in account services, participating in market research with Toyota at the 626 Night Market. This experience not only sharpened my communication skills but also provided invaluable insight into the dynamic and fast-paced world of advertising. It was during this internship that I attended weekly Master Class seminars, absorbing knowledge on agency operations, and actively contributed to market research initiatives, specifically targeting the vehicle and media habits of Asian Americans. The creation of surveys and engaging with the public at the 626 Night Market underscored my ability to translate theoretical concepts into practical strategies.

My involvement in the United Student Body (USB) at Diamond Bar High School showcases my dedication to leadership and community engagement. Serving as the Academics Commissioner from January 2022 to January 2023, I implemented a meticulous process to recognize academic achievements. This involved calculating GPAs, considering extracurricular activities, and evaluating recommendations from Grade Level Coordinators. Coordinating events like Academic Week and overseeing the Renaissance program allowed me to foster a culture of academic excellence within the student body. Furthermore, my role as the Commissioner of Hospitality from January 2021 to January 2022 positioned me as the official hostess of Diamond Bar High School. Representing USB at various school events, managing visitations on campus, and coordinating gestures of appreciation for staff members underscored my commitment to creating a positive and inclusive school environment.

Beyond academics, my foray into the working world continued as a Student Store Clerk at Diamond Bar High School from August 2022 to May 2022. Handling cashier duties during lunch and after-school, I managed the cash box and maintained inventory in the student store. This experience honed my financial acumen and organizational skills while providing a firsthand understanding of the responsibilities associated with retail operations within an educational setting. Venturing into the vibrant world of customer service, I took on the role of a Barista at Yin Yang Tea in Chino, CA, from May 2023 to October 2023. Crafting beverages, managing store operations, and ensuring customer satisfaction added a layer of versatility to my skill set, demonstrating adaptability in different professional environments.

Complementing my academic and professional endeavors, I dedicated several years to my passion for volleyball. As a Libero in Club Volleyball from 2017 to 2021 and a Right Side Hitter for the Diamond Bar High School Volleyball Team from 2021 to 2023, I not only honed my physical abilities but also developed strong teamwork and leadership skills. These experiences taught me the importance of discipline, perseverance, and effective communication within a team dynamic.

My proficiency extends beyond the field and court, as I possess a robust skill set in various software tools. Proficient in Microsoft Office, Adobe Creative Cloud (with a focus on Photoshop), Canva, and Google Suite, I am well-equipped with the technological acumen necessary for today's dynamic professional landscape. As I transition into the collegiate realm at UC Riverside, I carry with me a wealth of experiences, skills, and a genuine passion for making a positive impact in all my endeavors. My journey is marked by a commitment to continuous learning, a collaborative mindset, and an eagerness to contribute meaningfully to the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead.
